            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Julio Araujo, I was born in the city of Imperatriz, state of Maranhão, Brazil. I grew up with 3 sisters, one of whom is my twin. I enjoy reading books, especially those on personal development, walking in the city's parks, and taking walks with my wife. I work as a ride-sharing driver, and I am studying programming to have a career in the future.<img src="images/profile.webp" alt="profile"></p>
            <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest in the world, marked by its rich cultural diversity and biodiversity. Discovered in 1500 by Pedro Álvares Cabral, the country went through significant periods of colonization, slavery, and the struggle for independence, which culminated in 1822. With the influence of indigenous, African, and European cultures, Brazil is known for its vibrant aspects such as Carnival, music (including rhythms like samba and bossa nova), and a varied cuisine that reflects its regional traditions. Furthermore, the country is home to impressive natural beauties, such as the Amazon Rainforest and the Iguaçu Falls, as well as important social and economic challenges, such as inequality and poverty, which shape its contemporary identity.<img src="images/country.webp" alt="country"></p>
